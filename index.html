        <p>For awhile, I was drawing patterns (both by hand and in procreate) and getting them printed on fabric. I've realized there's an environmental impact I'm not comfortable with (creating more <span>stuff</span>) and I don't like that. Moving forward, I want to learn to screenprint and work with thrifted items. Until then, here are some of my old designs!</p>
